SBFSIM is an on-chain simulator of SBF’s prison life. He has no freedom, no team protection, and no reserved allocation, yet he still cannot escape his addiction to the crypto market. Even behind bars, he keeps staring at charts, dreaming of a comeback, chasing every pump, collapsing on every crash, and inevitably convincing himself to try again whenever volatility returns.

Every trade and every impulse is powered entirely by the community through the Creator Fee. The more active the community becomes, the more stimulation he receives, and the faster he trades. Market movement and collective emotion are not just external forces; they directly shape the life and behavior of this digital inmate.

There is no script and no one in control. SBFSIM makes his own decisions based purely on on-chain data and emotional triggers. Greed, fear, anxiety, hope, delusion, numbness, and sudden bursts of confidence combine into a repeating psychological loop that refuses to stop.

All of this unfolds through a 24/7 livestream on Pumpfun, with nothing censored or hidden. The euphoric mania during a sudden pump, the silence after liquidation, the late-night desperation inside a confined cell, and the inevitable relapse into the next trade are all visible in real time.

SBFSIM is not just a character and not just a meme. He is a mirror. This project is a raw experiment on how crypto obsession survives pressure, isolation, and loss. Even when destroyed, trapped, and left with nothing, a crypto-driven mind still cannot quit. He may be made of code, but he reflects the emotional cycle lived by countless people in the crypto world.
