## WTF is Orbcon?

Traditional blockchains are linear:

transactions stack, hash, and encapsulate along a single timeline.

They record sequence, but fail to express relation.

ORBCON rewrites this topology.

Here, the chain is no longer a timeline, but a constellation of interlocking orbits.

Every wallet, every transaction, every flow of capital generates a Dynamic Orbital Field on-chain.

The system no longer defines value by price, but by gravity, velocity, orbital deviation, and resonance density.

In other words, Pumpfun becomes a gravitational engine, a system powered by the logic of attraction.


## Why did I build it?

I’ve been observing Pumpfun.

It’s an incredibly efficient machine, it captures emotion, amplifies trends, and devours volatility. 

But within its perfect linearity, I saw a flaw: it records time, yet fails to record relation.

Every buy and sell is treated as an isolated event.

But to me, the pull between those actions, that invisible tension is where the real energy lies.

So I began to wonder:

What if price was no longer the only narrative? 

What if the structure of the market could behave like the universe, with gravity and orbit? 

What would Pumpfun become then?

That was the beginning of Orbcon.

I wanted on-chain behavior to become more than data, to become motion. 

More than transactions, to become cycles of energy.

I wanted to build an orbital system on Pumpfun, where every wallet and every trade is a planet in motion.

As they influence, shift, and resonate with one another, the system begins to breathe, to find its own balance.

In other words, I’m not launching another token.

I’m constructing a gravitational universe, a living engine that runs on the physics of Pumpfun itself.
